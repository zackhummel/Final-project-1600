A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the computer's brain, executing program instructions through a cycle of fetch, decode, execute, and store. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them into commands, executes tasks using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for calculations or logical operations, and stores results in registers or memory. The Control Unit directs these operations, while the CPU clock ensures synchronization. This rapid process enables the CPU to perform billions of operations per second, driving the computer's functionality. Also what sets apart different CPU's from each other is their clockspeeds and amount of cores. Each essentially making the CPU more faster with higher clockspeeds and higher cores. <br>
